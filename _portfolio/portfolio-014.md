This course content included the construction and analyzes of phylogenetic trees generated from sequence alignments, which was put into practice using the bioinformatic software MEGA (v6.0) to generate the sequence alignments using ClustalW and phylogenetic trees using the Neighbor-Joining Algorithm,  UPGMA, and Maximum Parsimony Algorithm. It also included methods from computational proteomics to analyze protein samples by generating their spectra matrix and from it compare the possible proteins to database proteins using the spectral alignment algortithm.
