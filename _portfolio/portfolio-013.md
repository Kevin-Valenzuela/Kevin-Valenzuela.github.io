This course content included the comparison of genes and proteins utilizing algorithms such as local, global, fitting, and overlap alignments, it also included the comparison of entire genomes by genome rearrangements. 
It also included the use of bioinformatic softwares to generate sequence alignments such as:
* <b>BLAST</b> (blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi)
* <b>global alignments</b> (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/jdispatcher/psa/emboss_needle)
* <b>local alignments</b> (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/jdispatcher/psa/emboss_water), 
* <b>multiple alignments</b> (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/jdispatcher/msa/emboss_cons)

And, also <b>sequence logos</b> (https://weblogo.threeplusone.com/create.cgi). All this with the end goal to compare different proteins to gramicidin synthetase to locate a A domain. Completed this course with honors.
