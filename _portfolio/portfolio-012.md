This course content included the graph theory, the use of brujin graphs algorithms to assemble genomes from single reads and pair-reads, and the process to sequece genome using next-generation sequencing (NGS), and the use of brute force algorithms to sequence proteins such as antibiotics from antimicrobial-resistant bacteria.
It also included the use of the bioinformatic software <b>Galaxy</b> to assemble the genome of a sample Staphylococcus from a fastq file into contigs and scaffolds using the <b>SPAdes</b> genome assembler and also to evaluate the quality of this assemblies using <b>QUAST</b>. Completed this course with honors.
