I'm a Bioengineering Ph.D. student at UC Santa Barbara since Fall 2024 interested in the implementation of synthetic biology for medical therapy design. I earned my Bachelor's degree in Biomedical Engineering in June 2023 at <em>Instituto Tecnol√≥gico de Tijuana</em>.

<!--My research interests are focus on synthetic and systems biology approaches to create medical treatments.-->
